## Introduction

The Terraform provider for Kustomize is available from the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kbst/kustomization/latest).

Please refer to the [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kbst/kustomization/latest/docs) for information on how to use the `kustomization_build` and `kustomization_overlay` data sources, or the `kustomization_resource` resource.

This is a standalone Terraform Provider, but is also used in the [Terraform GitOps framework Kubestack](https://www.kubestack.com/).

## Development Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12.x
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.13 (to build the provider plugin)


## Building and Developing the Provider

To work on the provider, you need go installed on your machine. The provider uses go mod to manage its dependencies, so GOPATH is not required.

To compile the provider, run `make build` as shown below. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `terraform.d/plugins/linux_amd64/` directory.

```sh
make build
```

In order to test the provider, run the acceptance tests using `make test`. You have to set the `KUBECONFIG_PATH` or `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to point the tests to a valid config file. Each tests uses an individual namespaces. [Kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) or [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) clusters work well for testing.

```sh
make test
```

### Running the provider under debug

Running in debug mode is a four step process - launch the plugin in debug mode under delve, connect your IDE to delve, connect terraform to the plugin, and
then run terraform. Instructions here are for Visual Studio Code, configuring other IDEs is likely to be a similar process

* Ensure you have [`delve` installed](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/installation)
* Build the plugin locally using `go build ./...`
* From the terraform repository you wish to debug, run the following
  ```
  PLUGIN_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS=5 dlv exec --api-version=2 --listen=127.0.0.1:49188 --headless /path/to/terraform-provider-kustomization/terraform-provider-kustomize -- --debug
  ```
  If you run this outside of the terraform repository (e.g. in the plugin source directory), kustomize gets very confused when trying to find files
* In Visual Studio Code, add the [following configuration to launch.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations)
  ```
    {
        "name": "Connect to server",
        "type": "go",
        "request": "attach",
        "mode": "remote",
        "remotePath": "${workspaceFolder}",
        "port": 49188,
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "apiVersion": 2,
        "env": {
            "KUBECONFIG_PATH": "${HOME}/.kube/config"
        },
        "dlvLoadConfig": {
            "followPointers": true,
            "maxVariableRecurse": 1,
            "maxStringLen": 512,
            "maxArrayValues": 64,
            "maxStructFields": -1
        }
    }
  ```
* Click the debug button and start `Connect to server`.
* From the terminal you started `dlv` from, you will see something like:
  ```
  Provider server started; to attach Terraform, set TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS to the following:
  {"registry.terraform.io/kbst/kustomization":{"Protocol":"grpc","Pid":13366,"Test":true,"Addr":{"Network":"unix","String":"/var/folders/7c/wdp684z11w1_6cj0d6lgl8hw0000gn/T/plugin2650218557"}}}
  ```
  Set this value using export `TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS={"registry...}}}` in the terminal you want to run terraform from
* Set any breakpoints you wish to use
* Run terraform


### Running a specific test in debug mode

* Add the following configuration to .vscode/launch.json, updating the `TestFunctionNameGoesHere`
  to the name of the function you want to test:

  ```
  {
      "name": "Launch test function",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "launch",
      "mode": "test",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/kustomize",
      "env": {
          "TF_ACC": "1",
          "KUBECONFIG_PATH": "${env:HOME}/.kube/config"
      },
      "args": [
          "-test.v",
          "-test.run",
          "^TestFunctionNameGoesHere$",
      ],
  }
  ```
* Set any breakpoints you want to set
* Click the debug button and choose "Launch test function" in the dropdown
